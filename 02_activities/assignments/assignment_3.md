# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Good Data Visualization (Lunar Phases)
        The Lunar Phases visualization is generally accessible. It uses a clear layout with legible labels and sufficient contrast between elements. The combination of colors and shapes helps convey information effectively, but it relies on color without alternative cues, which could be problematic for colorblind users. The simple design and clear explanation of each moon phase make the information accessible to a broad audience, regardless of their scientific background.
        Reproducibility is partially met, as the data about the lunar cycle is widely available and the process to create such a diagram is standard. However, the visualization does not explicitly provide information on its data sources or the methods used to create it, which limits full transparency and replicability.
        The visualization is equitable in terms of its neutral and factual presentation of scientific data. It avoids cultural, gender, or geographical biases, making it universally applicable and understandable. Its subject matter is relevant to audiences across the globe, which enhances its inclusivity.

        Bad Data Visualization (Historical Figures)
        The Historical Figures visualization struggles with accessibility due to its overwhelming complexity. The dense network of lines, small font sizes, and reliance on color without alternative cues makes it difficult for users to follow. The color scheme is not colorblind-friendly, and the visual noise detracts from clarity, limiting accessibility for visually impaired or neurodiverse individuals.
        Reproducibility is limited since the visualization does not provide its data sources or explain its methodology. Without transparency regarding how the figures were selected or how the connections were made, it is difficult to replicate the chartâ€™s findings.
        Equity concerns arise due to the overrepresentation of Eurocentric and male historical figures, which could marginalize contributions from other regions and genders. The design and language used may also exclude those with lower levels of education or unfamiliarity with the subject matter.

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Good Data Visualization (Lunar Phases)
        To improve accessibility, the design could incorporate patterns or textured shapes to complement the color scheme, ensuring readability for colorblind users. Adding alt text for visual elements would improve compatibility with screen readers.
        For reproducibility, a simple note indicating the data sources and methods used to create the visualization would provide clarity, enhancing the ability for others to recreate or modify the visualization.
        In terms of equity, while the visualization is already neutral and inclusive, offering multilingual options for non-English speakers could further broaden its accessibility and global reach.
        
        Bad Data Visualization (Historical Figures)
        To improve accessibility, the visualization needs to be simplified. Breaking it into smaller, focused sections would make it easier to understand. Using patterns alongside colors would make it accessible to colorblind users, while increasing font sizes and reducing visual noise would improve overall readability.
        For reproducibility, the chart should include clear data sources and methods, explaining how the figures were chosen and how the connections between them were made.
        In terms of equity, diversifying the representation of historical figures, including more non-Western and female figures, would make the chart more inclusive. Simplified language and explanations would also help reach a broader audience.
        
        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
